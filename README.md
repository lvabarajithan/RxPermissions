# RxPermissions

Reactive implementation of Android runtime permissions using RxJava3.

## Usage

This library provides simple and lightweight apis that emitts `PermissionResult`.

Requesting for permissions:

```java
RxPermissions(this).request(...)
```

Request for permission results (skips granted permission results):

```java
RxPermissions(this).requestSkipGranted(...)
```

Request for simple permission (Emitts `true` or `false`):

```java
RxPermissions(this).requestSimple(...)
```

The `PermissionResult` model:

```java
PermissionResult.index      // The index of requesting permission order
PermissionResult.permission // Manifest.permission.XXX
PermissionResult.granted    // true or false
PermissionResult.rationale  // true or false
```

> Incase of Android version < M, result is always true.

#### Points to remember

1. Already granted permission results are emitted as soon as requested with `.request(...)` method. (Eg. If camera permission is already granted, you can start the camera related work, while Android system is asking for remaining permission)
2. Use `.requestSkipGranted(...)` method to skip the results of already granted permission results.
3. Use `.requestSimple(...)` method to get just `true` or `false` values, if you don't care about rationale permission results.
